# UnifiedTestingFramework
A testing tool that can run HttpRequests for both SOAP and REST APIs. It can also be used in testing web applications using web automation framework. 

The test can be controlled using a Microsoft Excel File that contains the test cases. This file must follow a certain format to have a successful execution.  The value assertion could be compared using hard coded values in the test data sheet, or retrieve values from a database using SQL queries.  This tool will not require any programming codes or scripts so it can be used by anyone. With this, the preparation of automated test cases will also be faster. 

The tool will have an interface that lets the user import existing artifacts such as Swagger files or SoapUI projects to instantly create MS Excel files to be used in test automation. The GUI will also provide a module that can control the test execution and manage existing test suites.

Most of all, the toll will provide a detailed HTML report that is easy to read. The test execution can also be logged so the tool can provide a module for showing the execution history of each test case for tracking purposes.
